# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Here is the data for the project:

The zip file was downloaded on the desktop and extracted to unzip the files. 

Three files have been created as part of this project -
- R script called run_analysis.R that imports the data, merges the training and test sets, extracts only the required columns and then applies averages 
- averages_data.txt - which comprises of the data which is the output of the program after tidy up
- CodeBook.md - which contains descriptions of all the variables and processing steps
